  This firmware aids in troubleshooting I2C connectivity issues on the Tracker One's M8 connector. Using a pre-built binary or compiling from source, it scans the I2C bus for devices and reports their addresses, helping diagnose connection issues.

  - Powers the Tracker I2C bus
  - Scans for devices, showing their I2C addresses
